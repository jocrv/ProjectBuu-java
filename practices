variables,
concets, creation, type of data, arithmetic operations, convertions (casting)
programming logical intellij 


Problem Explanation
A popular programming norm is to use Camel case when creating variable names. Notice the first word is lowercase and every following word is uppercase. Here are some examples:

var camelCase;
var someNumber;
var theBestVariableEver;
var weWillStoreNumbersInThisVariable;

-------

variables: the space in computer where you reserve values. 4 types: instance (object), class(class), local(inside the methods), parameters (signature of methods)
object oriented, 
main method, to dispareted the programming
definition standard:
<?visibility?> <?modificated?> typ of name <?=initialvalue?>; 
V: "public", "protected" and "private"
M: "static" and "final"  (the value doesnt change)
T: type of data 
N: name of are given to variable
VI: a initial value, if you desire 

created:
conventions and rules:
doesnt need to start with number; 
so allow "$" and "_" have to be avoid; 
is case-sensitive;
no spaces 
doesnt need to be reserved to java:
abstract continue for new switch assert default goto package synchedboolean do if private this break double case implements throw protected public while super
examples: 
int i; 
int I; 
int 1a; (uncorrect)
int_1a;
int $aq; 
int I = 10; 
int final j= 10; 
int asrn24678md; 
int asrn246 78md; (uncorrect)
int asrn2$4678_md = 10; 
int asrn2$46%78_md = 10; (uncorrect)


all start the variable with minimun letter; 
expressive names;
notation Camel
if the constant (final) capital letter and spaces by "_"; 


examples:
int quantityProduct; 
int QuantityProduct; (uncorrect)
int final NUMBER_INITIATIVES = 5; (standard notation)
int final numberInitiatives = 5; (uncorrect)
int NUMBER_INITIATIVES = 5; (uncorrect)
INT qtdProd; (uncorrect)
int i; 

good practice, 

create a example with intllij and the variable usable:
